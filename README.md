# TTB - Twitter Tournament Bot

This is my first twitter bot. It's a fictional tournament where players can 'fight' to see who will be the winner.

## Setup

1. Fill the variables in data_secrets.py with your own Twitter API keys.
2. Fill raw_player_list in data_players.py with your own players' data.
3. Fill the variables in data_items.py with your own items' data.
4. Modify the output texts in literals.py to make it funnier.
5. Run main.py

## To fix

- Divide the process into 2 steps: First generate a file with the tweets and seconds tweet them.
- Reduce the possibility of picking items.
- Reduce the possibility of reviving.
- Displayed awaking time is 1 hour before.

## Ideas

- Loading data via DM.
- Introduce places.
- Introduce life points.
- Attach an image with the summary of the action/ of the tournament results.
- Introduce teams.
- Leave traps in places.
- Display remaining alive players.
- Gender-friendly literals
