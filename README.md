# TTB - Twitter Tournament Bot

This is my first twitter bot. It's a fictional tournament where players can 'fight' to see who will be the winner.

1. Fill the variables in data_secrets.py with your own Twitter API keys.
2. Fill raw_player_list in data_players.py with your own players' data.
3. Fill the variables in data_items.py with your own items' data.
4. Modify the output texts in literals.py to make it funnier.
5. Run start.py

## To Do
- Cross destroyed districts
- fix winner conditions with districts

## Bugs
- too many treasons at the beginning
- improve treason text
- districts are often not destroyed
