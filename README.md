# TTB - Twitter Tournament Bot

This is my first twitter bot. It's a fictional tournament where players can 'fight' to see who will be the winner.

## Setup

1. Fill the variables in data_secrets.py with your own Twitter API keys.
2. Fill raw_player_list in data_players.py with your own players' data.
3. Fill the variables in data_items.py with your own items' data.
4. Modify the output texts in literals.py to make it funnier.
5. Run main.py

## Todo

1. Escape from destroyed cities
2. Destroyed world theme
